1. Create a directory on your computer and initialize a Git repository in it.
2. Add a text file to the repository, which contains your name and matriculation number. Commit the text file to the repository. Use meaningful commit messages for this and all following commits.
3.  Add a .gitignore file to your repository that causes MS Word files (.doc and .docx) to be ignored for the repository. Commit the .gitignore file to the repository.
4. Verify that the .gitignore file works by creating an MS Word file in the directory of the repository. Check the output of git status and copy that output in a file called MS-Word-status.txt. Commit that file to the repository, as well.
